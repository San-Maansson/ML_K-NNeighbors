# Machine Learning using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

The purpose of this depository is to study the use of KNN classifier to categorize an object based on the samples that come closest to it.
Have a look at the file for further explanation.

# What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm?

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. While it can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off the assumption that similar points can be found near one another.
